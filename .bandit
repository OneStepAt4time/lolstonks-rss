# Skips for worktree_manager.py subprocess calls and safe SQL patterns
# B101: assert used (intentional for type narrowing in circuit_breaker.py)
# B404: import subprocess (worktree_manager.py uses subprocess for git operations)
# B607: start process with partial path (git is in PATH, intentional)
# B603: subprocess without shell equals true (using list form, safe from shell injection)
# B608: hardcoded SQL - safe when using parameterized queries with ? placeholders
